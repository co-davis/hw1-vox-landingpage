###What worked
I was able to layout the page in HTML, add in fonts and icons from Google Fonts and FontAwesome, and add a background cover image. I was also able to format the nav bar using flexboxes.


###What didn't work
After that, I got stuck trying to format the rest of the page. Any CSS changes I made to children of the "main" div below the navbar would not apply. I tried to do simple things like changing "background-color" of various divs to try to debug the issue but to no avail (that's why the email form and "Let's make some shirts!" text have a green background).
